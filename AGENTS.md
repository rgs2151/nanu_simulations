# Project Rules

- Read `ORGANIZATION.md`, `STYLE.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` before changing analysis or figure code.
- Use `ORGANIZATION.md` for folder layout, compact-unit rules, cache/plot ownership, README structure, and package placement.
- Use `STYLE.md` for figure appearance.
- Use `DECISIONS.md` only for choices that must stay consistent across multiple analyses.
- When revising compact-unit READMEs, apply the `rudra-iterate-unit-readme` standard: each script/output gets its own H1 and complete repeated sections.
- Compact-unit README H2 sections are `Method`, `Variables`, `Statistics`, `Legends`, `Interpretation`, `Notes`, and `References`.
- In compact-unit README `Statistics` sections, state each statistic/model/test, the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis, the threshold or decision rule, what the statistic means, and why it is appropriate for the unit's comparison.
- Put unit-specific file paths, record subsets, exclusions, thresholds, statistical tests, statistical-test justification, cache names, and panel mappings in the compact unit README, not in `DECISIONS.md`.
- In compact-unit README legends, define color/value signals explicitly; never write vague labels like activity, value, score, or output without saying exactly what measurement or derived quantity is shown.
- Keep code simple and direct. Do not add broad abstractions or edge-case handling unless asked.
- Do not add compatibility shims, old/new layout branches, migration bridges, or fallback APIs unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Fix current code to the current project contract. Do not preserve broken old interfaces.
- Do not add try/except blocks unless asked. For expected analysis conditions, use direct checks before the operation.
- Keep notebook cells clean: no extra print statements, no process notes, and code comments only when useful.
- Do not run analyses, notebooks, or figure generation unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not add or run tests for routine summaries, documentation, or plotting edits. Reserve tests for explicitly requested or substantively important engine/scientific changes.
- Plotting-only edits must reuse caches; do not rerun simulations. Follow the current Arial, solid-line style in STYLE.md.
- File moves and text edits are okay for organization tasks.
- Do not move, overwrite, regenerate, or clean files in `data/` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not modify, overwrite, regenerate, or clean result artifacts unless the user explicitly asks for that artifact action.
- Plot outputs are tracked repo artifacts. When regenerating a figure, delete that unit's previous plot/table outputs before writing the new iteration.
- Cache outputs are local compute artifacts and should stay ignored unless the user explicitly asks to track a cache file.
- After major repo organization changes, commit and push when this repo uses git remotes.

# Code Placement

- `protein_simulation/` is the installable project package for shared helpers used by `parking/`, `figs/`, and `debug/`.
- Put shared simulation dynamics, scientific parameter definitions, and analysis-neutral helpers in `protein_simulation/`.
- Maintain one core simulation engine; future conditions must reuse it rather than copy simulation loops. Implement new model conditions only when requested.
- Keep figure-specific and analysis-specific functions inside the compact unit that owns the figure or analysis.
- Do not create or expand broad figure-function dumps outside the owning unit.
- Active work must not contain `_legacy.py`, `_figure_functions.py`, or similar holding files.
- When moving code out of a notebook or reference file, place each figure or analysis function directly in the compact unit that owns it.

# Workflow Notes

- Prefer moving historical material into `ref/` over deleting it when it may still explain where current code came from.
- Prefer moving investigation outputs into a parked compact unit over leaving completed work in `debug/`.
- Leave unrelated user changes in place and work around them.
